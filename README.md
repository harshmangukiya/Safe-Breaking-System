# Safe-Breaking-System
This repository includes code for the Safe Breaking System for Vehicles

Self Braking system provides solution for car crash due to inadequete braking distance.

The car will be controlled by driver when it is operating in Safe Braking Range.
Safe Braking Range is a range which determines that car will collide or not if break is pressed. As braking distance will vary depending upon friction of surface, our system will measure braking distance based upon current speed and friction.

Self Braking System comes into action immediately when car enters in unsafe zone. Speed of car is reduced or completely stopped depending upon situation. 

Details of car such as speed and braking distance is commnunicated to users mobile. Real time preview of car along with its location is also provided to user remotly using cloud services.
